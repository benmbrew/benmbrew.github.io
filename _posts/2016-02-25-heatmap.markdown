description: Majority of the diseases are very heterogeneous. To move us closer to precision medicine, we have to identify more homogeneous subtypes with the corresponding genetic signatures. We have developed a graph-based clustering and feature ranking method that is robust to noise measurement and large numbers of irrelevant features, helping us to identify more clinically relevant subtypes.
