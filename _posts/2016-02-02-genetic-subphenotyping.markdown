description: If we suppose that each disease is actually a collection of multiple diseases (easily imaginable for spectrum disorders), then identifying genetic variants that predispose one to this disease, should be done simultaneously with the identification of the disease subtypes. We have extended an epistatic model to identify disease subtypes simultaneously with marginal and epistatic variants. (Colak et al, Bioinformatics, 2015)
