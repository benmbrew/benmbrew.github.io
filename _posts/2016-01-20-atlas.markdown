description: Each biological measurement provides a different insight into the mechanisms and causes behind diseases and biological processes. Our Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) approach combines multiple biological datasets by representing each  data type as a similarity network over samples and then fusing these networks into one global network using non-linear cross diffusion process. (Wang et al, Nature Methods 2014). The code and data are here
